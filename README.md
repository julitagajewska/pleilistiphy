### Description
An application that communicates with Spotify API to get users' playlists and, using the k-means clustering algorithm, separates tracks from one playlist into multiple new ones. Tracks from one collection are grouped based on similar features like acousticness, danceability, or loudness. The application will allow users to save the characteristic mood of a playlist as a filter. Other functionalities include the built-in player, filtering tracks by modifying feature sliders, and displaying interactive graphs like track length histogram or feature distribution donut chart. 

### Features
- Splitting existing playlist into smaller new ones based on the features of the parent playlist's tracks
